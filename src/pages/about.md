Dum Search is a basic webpage that makes it easier to perform "Web" searches on Google.

In May 2024, [Google introduced a "Web" search filter](https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1790473952256786805) that removes AI-generated results and other clutter, leaving only traditional search results (commonly referred to as "10 blue links").

Unfortunately, the Web filter is not always easily accessible, and there is currently no straightforward way to make it your default search setting on Google. That's where Dum Search steps in!

Dum Search functions like the standard Google search page but redirects your searches to Google <strong>with the Web filter automatically applied</strong>. The result is a search experience that feels more like old-school Google.

If you dislike Google's AI Overview answers or simply prefer the cleaner look and feel of traditional search results, then [Dum Search](/) is a tool you may find useful.

## How does it work?

When you click on the Web filter on Google, a "udm=14" URL parameter is applied. For example, a search with the Web filter looks something like this:

https://www.google.com/search?q=dum%20search&<b>udm=14</b>

So all Dum Search is doing is appending "udm=14" to the end of your search query, giving you the Web results right away. This saves you from having to click around on Google's interface to add the Web filter after already doing a search.

## What's with the name?

The name <i>Dum Search</i> is a play on the word "dumb" and pokes fun at the traditional "10 blue links" way of searching on Google as being rudimentary compared to the "intelligent" AI search results that now exist.

"Dum" is also an anagram for the "<b>udm</b>=14" URL parameter that is used to get the Web search results.

## Does Dum Search track what I search?

Nope! Dum Search doesn't use any analytics or track anything you are searching. This site was just a fun little weekend project and is not being utilized in any way other than for personal convenience.
