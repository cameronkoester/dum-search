# Dum Search

This is the source code for [dumsearch.com](https://dumsearch.com/), a basic webpage that makes it easier to perform "Web" searches on Google.

The core functionality is just some simple Javascript that performs a Google search with your input and appends "udm=14" to the end of the URL, enabling the "Web" search filter.

The rest of the site is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
